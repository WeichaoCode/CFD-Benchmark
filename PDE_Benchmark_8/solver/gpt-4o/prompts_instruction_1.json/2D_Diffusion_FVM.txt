Below is the Python code to solve the given steady-state PDE problem using the Finite Volume Method (FVM) with the specified parameters and conditions. The solution is saved as a `.npy` file.

```python
import numpy as np

# Parameters
mu = 1e-3  # dynamic viscosity (PaÂ·s)
dP_dz = -3.2  # pressure gradient (Pa/m)
h = 0.1  # domain height (m)
n_x = n_y = 80  # number of grid points
dx = dy = h / (n_x - 1)  # grid spacing

# Coefficients
a_E = a_W = mu * dy / dx
a_N = a_S = mu * dx / dy
a_P = a_E + a_W + a_N + a_S
S_u = dP_dz * dx * dy

# Initialize velocity field
w = np.zeros((n_x, n_y))

# Jacobi iteration parameters
tolerance = 1e-6
max_iterations = 10000

# Jacobi iteration
for iteration in range(max_iterations):
    w_old = w.copy()
    
    for i in range(1, n_x - 1):
        for j in range(1, n_y - 1):
            w[i, j] = (a_W * w_old[i-1, j] + a_E * w_old[i+1, j] +
                       a_S * w_old[i, j-1] + a_N * w_old[i, j+1] +
                       S_u) / a_P
    
    # Check for convergence
    if np.linalg.norm(w - w_old, ord=np.inf) < tolerance:
        print(f"Converged after {iteration+1} iterations.")
        break
else:
    print("Did not converge within the maximum number of iterations.")

# Save the final solution
np.save('velocity_field.npy', w)
```

### Explanation:
- **Domain Discretization**: The domain is discretized into a uniform grid with `n_x` by `n_y` points.
- **Coefficients Calculation**: The coefficients for the finite volume method are calculated based on the given parameters.
- **Jacobi Iteration**: The Jacobi iterative method is used to solve the linear system resulting from the discretization. The iteration continues until the solution converges within a specified tolerance or the maximum number of iterations is reached.
- **Boundary Conditions**: The no-slip boundary condition is inherently satisfied by initializing the velocity field to zero and not updating the boundary values during iterations.
- **Solution Saving**: The final velocity field is saved as a `.npy` file using NumPy.

This code will compute the steady-state solution for the velocity field in the z-direction and save it as a 2D NumPy array.
