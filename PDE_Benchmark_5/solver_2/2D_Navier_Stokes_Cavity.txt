Here, you're basically looking for a python script that will solve the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using a Finite Difference Method (FDM). However, since this platform doesn't support running full scripts interactively, we are unable to test and debug the entire script here. 

Still, I can guide you on how this 'dx' error can be corrected. Likely, 'dx' (and similar parameters like 'dy', 'ν', etc.) are defining the space step for finite difference approximations but they were not defined in the script. 

You need to define them in your script before you use them. Note that, 'dx' and 'dy' are space discretization steps, while ν in this context is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid, 'dt' represents the time step. 

Here is how you can define them at the start of your 'update_velocity_fields' function:

```
def update_velocity_fields(u, v, p, dx, dy, dt, ν):
   # your function implementation

# define space step and other parameters
dx, dy, dt, ν = 0.05, 0.05, 0.01, 1.0

# Now you call the update_velocity_fields function
u, v = update_velocity_fields(u, v, p, dx, dy, dt, ν)
```

This error is mostly occurring because 'dx' was used in your function 'update_velocity_fields' but was not defined previously in your code.

However, for better debugging, it's advisable to run your python code on your local machine or any python supported platform like Jupyter notebook, PyCharm, or Google Colab where you can test, debug and visualize your complete script.

If the problem persists, the most feasible way in this scenario would be to share the entire script, and then it would be possible to provide a more precise solution.
