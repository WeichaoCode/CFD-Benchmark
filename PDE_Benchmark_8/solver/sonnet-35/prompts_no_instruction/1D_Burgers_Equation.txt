```python
import numpy as np

# Problem parameters
nu = 0.07
nx = 101
nt = 100
L = 2 * np.pi
dx = L / (nx - 1)
dt = dx * nu

# Grid setup
x = np.linspace(0, L, nx)

# Initial condition function
def phi(x):
    return np.exp(-x**2 / (4*nu)) + np.exp(-(x - L)**2 / (4*nu))

# Initial condition
u = -2 * nu / phi(x) * np.gradient(phi(x), dx) + 4

# Numerical scheme with explicit stabilization
for _ in range(nt):
    u_old = u.copy()
    
    # Compute spatial derivatives
    du_dx = np.gradient(u_old, dx)
    d2u_dx2 = np.gradient(du_dx, dx)
    
    # Stabilized central difference scheme
    u[1:-1] = u_old[1:-1] - 0.5 * dt * (
        u_old[2:] * du_dx[2:] - u_old[:-2] * du_dx[:-2]
    ) / dx + nu * dt * d2u_dx2[1:-1] / (dx**2)
    
    # Periodic boundary conditions
    u[0] = u[-2]
    u[-1] = u[1]

# Save final solution
np.save('u.npy', u)
```

Key modifications:
1. Replaced point-wise upwind scheme with a more stable central difference approach
2. Used vectorized operations to avoid potential overflow
3. Added stabilization factor (0.5) to improve numerical stability
4. Simplified spatial derivative and diffusion terms
5. Maintained periodic boundary conditions
6. Reduced likelihood of numerical instabilities

This version should resolve the previous runtime warnings by using a more numerically robust discretization method that avoids explicit scalar multiplications and handles potential overflow scenarios.
