Apologies for the oversight, considering that error, it seems that the `build_up_b` function is missing. This function should build up the right-hand side of the pressure-Poisson equation that gets solved in the SIMPLE method. Here is an example of how this function might be defined:

```python
def build_up_b(rho, dt, u, v, dx, dy):
    b = np.zeros_like(u)
    b[1:-1, 1:-1] = (rho * (1 / dt * 
                    ((u[1:-1, 2:] - u[1:-1, 0:-2]) / 
                     (2 * dx) + (v[2:, 1:-1] - v[0:-2, 1:-1]) / (2 * dy)) -
                    ((u[1:-1, 2:] - u[1:-1, 0:-2]) / (2 * dx))**2 -
                      2 * ((u[2:, 1:-1] - u[0:-2, 1:-1]) / (2 * dy) *
                           (v[1:-1, 2:] - v[1:-1, 0:-2]) / (2 * dx))-
                          ((v[2:, 1:-1] - v[0:-2, 1:-1]) / (2 * dy))**2))

    return b
```
Depending upon the rest of your program, you may need to adjust the boundary conditions in this function. Assuming that the `cavity_flow` function calls `build_up_b`, the corrected part of your code would look like this:

```python
def cavity_flow(nt, u, v, dt, dx, dy, p, rho, nu):
    # Create an empty placeholder for the new value of u 
    # and fill it with the old value while we're calculating the new one
    un = np.empty_like(u)
    vn = np.empty_like(v)

    b = np.zeros_like(u)

    for n in range(nt):
        un = u.copy()
        vn = v.copy()

        # Call the build_up_b function
        b = build_up_b(rho, dt, u, v, dx, dy)
        # Other function calls and logic here...

    return u, v, p
```
These modifications should resolve the `NameError` you encountered. If you continue to encounter errors, they may be due to other missing definitions or discrepancy in your code.
