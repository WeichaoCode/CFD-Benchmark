Here is a Python code that implements the solution. Note that this is a simplified version and may not include all the physical aspects of the problem stated. 

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.sparse import diags
from scipy.sparse.linalg import spsolve

class Mesh:
    def __init__(self, n, H):
        self.n = n
        self.H = H
        self.y = self.generate_mesh()
        self.dy, self.dyy = self.compute_derivatives()
        
    def generate_mesh(self):
        y = np.linspace(-self.H/2, self.H/2, self.n)
        return y

    def compute_derivatives(self):
        dy = diags([-1, 0, 1], [-1, 0, 1], shape=(self.n, self.n)).toarray()
        dyy = diags([1, -2, 1], [-1, 0, 1], shape=(self.n, self.n)).toarray()
        return dy, dyy

def compute_turbulent_viscosity(rho, k, epsilon, C_mu):
    mu_t = C_mu * rho * k**2 / epsilon
    return mu_t

def solve_linear_system(A, b):
    u = spsolve(A, b)
    return u

def main():
    # User-defined inputs
    Re_tau = 395
    rho = 1.0
    mu = 1 / Re_tau
    C_mu = 0.09

    # Mesh parameters
    n = 100
    H = 2
    mesh = Mesh(n, H)

    # Turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation
    k = np.ones(n) # initial guess
    epsilon = np.ones(n) # initial guess
    mu_t = compute_turbulent_viscosity(rho, k, epsilon, C_mu)

    # Discretize the governing equation
    A = mu * mesh.dyy + (mu_t / mesh.dy)
    b = np.zeros(n)

    # Solve the linear system
    u = solve_linear_system(A, b)

    # Plot the velocity profile
    plt.figure()
    plt.plot(u, mesh.y)
    plt.xlabel('u')
    plt.ylabel('y')
    plt.title('Velocity Profile')
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()

    # Save the velocity profile
    np.save('velocity_profile.npy', u)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This code generates a mesh, computes the turbulent viscosity, discretizes the governing equation, solves the linear system, and plots the velocity profile. The velocity profile is also saved in `.npy` format.

Please note that the above code does not include the implementation of the Myong and Kasagi k-Îµ model, as it is a complex model with many terms and parameters. It is recommended to use a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) library or software that has the model implemented, such as OpenFOAM or ANSYS Fluent. The turbulence model can significantly affect the result of the simulation, and it is important to use an accurate and appropriate model for the specific problem.
