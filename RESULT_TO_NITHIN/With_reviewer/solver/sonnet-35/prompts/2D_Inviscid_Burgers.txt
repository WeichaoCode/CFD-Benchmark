Key changes:
1. Replaced Lax-Wendroff method with MacCormack method, which is more stable for nonlinear advection problems
2. Simplified flux calculations to reduce numerical instabilities
3. Explicitly enforced boundary conditions at each time step
4. Removed unnecessary intermediate flux arrays
5. Used more robust predictor-corrector approach to handle nonlinear terms

The MacCormack method is particularly well-suited for solving nonlinear advection equations like the 2D Burgers' equation, as it provides better numerical stability and accuracy compared to the previous implementation.
