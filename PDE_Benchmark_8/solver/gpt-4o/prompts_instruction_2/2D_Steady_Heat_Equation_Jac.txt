Below is the Python code to solve the given 2D Laplace equation using the finite difference method with Jacobi iteration. The code initializes the temperature field, applies the boundary conditions, iterates to solve the PDE, and saves the final temperature distribution in a `.npy` file. It also generates a contour plot to visualize the temperature distribution.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the domain and grid
Lx, Ly = 5.0, 4.0
dx, dy = 0.05, 0.05
nx, ny = int(Lx/dx) + 1, int(Ly/dy) + 1

# Initialize the temperature field
T = np.zeros((ny, nx))

# Apply Dirichlet boundary conditions
T[:, 0] = 10.0  # Left boundary
T[:, -1] = 40.0  # Right boundary
T[0, :] = 0.0  # Top boundary
T[-1, :] = 20.0  # Bottom boundary

# Jacobi iteration parameters
tolerance = 1e-5
max_iterations = 10000
iteration = 0
residual = np.inf

# Jacobi iteration
while residual > tolerance and iteration < max_iterations:
    T_new = T.copy()
    
    # Update the temperature field using the Jacobi method
    for j in range(1, ny-1):
        for i in range(1, nx-1):
            T_new[j, i] = 0.25 * (T[j+1, i] + T[j-1, i] + T[j, i+1] + T[j, i-1])
    
    # Compute the residual
    residual = np.max(np.abs(T_new - T))
    
    # Update the temperature field
    T = T_new
    
    # Increment the iteration counter
    iteration += 1

# Save the final temperature field to a .npy file
np.save('temperature_distribution.npy', T)

# Plot the temperature distribution
X, Y = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(0, Lx, nx), np.linspace(0, Ly, ny))
plt.contourf(X, Y, T, 20, cmap='hot')
plt.colorbar(label='Temperature (Â°C)')
plt.title('Temperature Distribution')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.show()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Domain and Grid Initialization**: The domain is defined with a grid spacing of `dx = 0.05` and `dy = 0.05`, resulting in a grid size of `nx = 101` and `ny = 81`.

2. **Temperature Field Initialization**: The temperature field `T` is initialized to zero, and the Dirichlet boundary conditions are applied.

3. **Jacobi Iteration**: The Jacobi method is used to iteratively update the temperature field until the residual is below a specified tolerance or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

4. **Saving the Solution**: The final temperature distribution is saved in a `.npy` file using NumPy.

5. **Visualization**: A contour plot is generated to visualize the temperature distribution across the domain.
