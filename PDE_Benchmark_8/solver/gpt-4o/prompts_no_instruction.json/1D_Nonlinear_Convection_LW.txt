Below is the complete and runnable Python code to solve the given PDE problem using the Lax-Wendroff method. The code computes the solution at the final time step and saves it as a `.npy` file.

```python
import numpy as np

# Parameters
L = 2 * np.pi
nu = 0.5
dt = 0.01
dx = dt / nu
T = 500  # number of time steps

# Discretize the spatial domain
x = np.linspace(0, L, int(np.ceil(L / dx)), endpoint=False)
nx = len(x)

# Initial condition
u = np.sin(x) + 0.5 * np.sin(0.5 * x)

# Lax-Wendroff method
for n in range(T):
    u_next = np.zeros_like(u)
    for i in range(nx):
        # Periodic boundary conditions
        ip1 = (i + 1) % nx
        im1 = (i - 1) % nx
        
        # Lax-Wendroff scheme
        u_next[i] = (u[i] - 0.5 * dt / dx * u[i] * (u[ip1] - u[im1]) +
                     0.5 * (dt / dx)**2 * u[i]**2 * (u[ip1] - 2 * u[i] + u[im1]))
    
    u = u_next

# Save the final solution
np.save('final_solution.npy', u)
```

### Explanation:
- **Parameters**: The spatial domain is discretized using `np.linspace` with periodic boundary conditions. The time step `dt` and spatial step `dx` are defined based on the given parameters.
- **Initial Condition**: The initial condition is set as a combination of sine functions.
- **Lax-Wendroff Method**: The method is implemented in a loop over time steps. For each spatial point, the next time step value is computed using the Lax-Wendroff scheme, considering periodic boundary conditions.
- **Saving the Solution**: After completing the time integration, the final solution is saved as a `.npy` file using `np.save`.
