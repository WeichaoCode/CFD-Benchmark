It appears there was a command error, most likely because the code was not originally in a python file but instead part of a Jupyter notebook (where commands using '!' are available). You can fix this issue by installing the necessary packages (numpy and matplotlib) separately and removing the first line in your code. 

Here's the corrected code: 

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Define parameters
H = 1.0 # channel height
ny = 100 # number of grid points in y-direction
mu = 1e-3 # kinematic viscosity
mu_t = 0.01 # eddy viscosity

y = np.linspace(0, H, ny) # grid points in y-direction

# Step 2: Discretize the domain using finite differences
dy = y[1] - y[0] # grid spacing in y-direction
A = np.zeros((ny,ny)) # coefficient matrix
B = -np.ones(ny) # right-hand side vector

# Step 3: Assemble the coefficient matrix A and right-hand side vector B
# Apply central difference for interior points and Dirichlet conditions at the boundaries
for i in range(1, ny-1):
    A[i, i-1] = -(mu + mu_t) / dy**2
    A[i, i+1] = -(mu + mu_t) / dy**2
    A[i, i] = 2*(mu + mu_t) / dy**2
A[0, 0] = A[-1, -1] = 1.0

# Step 4: Solve the linear system for u
u = np.linalg.solve(A, B)

# Step 5: Visualize the velocity profile
plt.figure()
plt.plot(u, y)
plt.xlabel('Velocity u')
plt.ylabel('Height y')
plt.title('Fully-developed turbulent channel flow')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
In this code, `numpy` is used for numerical operations and matrix manipulation, and `matplotlib` is used to plot the velocity profile. The channel flow problem is solved by discretizing the differential equation, assembling a system of algebraic equations, solving it using a direct method, and visualizing the results. The boundary conditions are directly included by setting the first and last rows of the coefficient matrix as [1, 0, ..., 0] and [0, ..., 0, 1], respectively.
