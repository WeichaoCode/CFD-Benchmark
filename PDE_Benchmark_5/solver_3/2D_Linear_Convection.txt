The TypeError raised in the previously generated codes is due to the use of 3D projection arguments in case where matplotlib does not support 3D plots natively. This feature can only be added through an external toolkit.

Correcting this error requires importing the necessary toolkit for 3D plotting before using 'projection = 3d'. Here is an example of how to use it:

```python
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D
```

This import should be added before creating a 3D plot.

Another issue found in previous codes is due to the use of '!pip install'. In python code, these commands should be removed and required packages should be installed manually or added in the documentation for users to install. 

Also, there are NameErrors due to undefined variables 'nt'. This error can be fixed by ensuring that all variables are properly defined before they are used. 

Now, the corrected version of the required python code follows:

```python

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

# Define parameters 
Lx, Ly = 2, 2
nx, ny = 81, 81
nt = 100
c = 1
dx = Lx / (nx - 1)
dy = Ly / (ny - 1)
sigma = .2
dt = sigma * dx

x = np.linspace(0, Lx, nx)
y = np.linspace(0, Ly, ny)
u = np.ones((ny, nx))

mask = np.where((x >= 0.5) & (x <= 1))
u[mask] = 2
u_old = u.copy()

for n in range(nt):
    u_old = u.copy()
    u[1:, 1:] = (u_old[1:, 1:] - (c * dt / dx * (u_old[1:, 1:] - u_old[1:, :-1])) - (c * dt / dy * (u_old[1:, 1:] - u_old[:-1, 1:])))
    u[0, :] = 1
    u[-1, :] = 1
    u[:, 0] = 1
    u[:, -1] = 1

# Create a 3D plot
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(11, 7), dpi=100)
ax = Axes3D(fig)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
ax.plot_surface(X, Y, u[:], cmap="viridis")
plt.show()
```
This code generates a plot showing the 2D convection pattern over the grid for the specified parameters. Please note that this is a simple illustration and may need further validation/verification for your specific use case.

Copy and run the code in your local environment and ensure that all the necessary packages are installed.
