This code sets up and solves the given PDE using a finite difference method with periodic boundary conditions. The initial condition is calculated based on the provided formula, and the solution is evolved in time using an explicit time-stepping scheme. The final solution is saved as a 1D NumPy array in a file named `u.npy`.
