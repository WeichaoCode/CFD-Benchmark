Certainly! The error arises because the lengths of the arrays being assigned to the diagonals do not match the expected size. Let's correct the code by ensuring the diagonals are constructed properly:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.sparse import diags
from scipy.sparse.linalg import spsolve

# Parameters
H = 2.0  # Height of the domain
n = 100  # Number of grid points
mu = 1.0  # Molecular viscosity

# Cess model parameters
A_plus = 26.0
B = 1.0 / 0.41
Re_tau = 5200.0

# Non-uniform grid clustering near the walls
y = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
y = H * (1 - np.cos(np.pi * y)) / 2

# Compute dy
dy = np.diff(y)

# Initialize velocity field
ubar = np.zeros(n)

# Compute turbulent viscosity using Cess model
def compute_mu_t(y, H, Re_tau, A_plus, B):
    eta = y / H
    return 0.5 * (1 + np.tanh(A_plus * (eta - 0.5))) * (1 - np.exp(-B * eta * Re_tau))

mu_t = compute_mu_t(y, H, Re_tau, A_plus, B)
mu_eff = mu + mu_t

# Construct the finite difference matrix
lower_diag = mu_eff[:-1] / dy
upper_diag = mu_eff[1:] / dy
main_diag = -(np.concatenate(([0], lower_diag)) + np.concatenate((upper_diag, [0]))) / np.concatenate(([1], dy))

# Boundary conditions
main_diag[0] = 1.0
main_diag[-1] = 1.0

# Right-hand side
rhs = np.full(n, -1.0)
rhs[0] = 0.0  # ubar = 0 at y = 0
rhs[-1] = 0.0  # ubar = 0 at y = H

# Solve the linear system
A = diags([lower_diag, main_diag, upper_diag], offsets=[-1, 0, 1], format='csc')
ubar = spsolve(A, rhs)

# Save the final solution
np.save('ubar.npy', ubar)
```

In this corrected version, the diagonals are constructed with the correct sizes, ensuring that the main diagonal has the same length as the number of grid points, and the lower and upper diagonals are one element shorter. The boundary conditions are applied directly to the main diagonal and the right-hand side.
