The error you're encountering is because the variable `epsilon` was not defined within the scope of the `solve_k_omega` function. To fix this, we need to ensure that `epsilon` is defined within the function where it is used.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

# Constants and parameters
H = 2.0
n = 100
rho = 1.0  # Density
mu = 1.0e-3  # Dynamic viscosity
beta_star = 0.09
beta = 0.075
a1 = 0.31
C_D = 0.0  # Assuming a constant for simplicity
F1 = 1.0  # Assuming a constant for simplicity
F2 = 1.0  # Assuming a constant for simplicity
sigma_k = 0.5
sigma_omega = 0.5

# Discretization
y = np.linspace(0, H, n)
dy = np.gradient(y)

# Initial conditions
k = np.zeros(n)
omega = np.zeros(n)

# Helper functions
def compute_mu_t(k, omega, S):
    # Avoid division by zero by adding a small epsilon
    epsilon = 1e-10
    omega_safe = np.maximum(omega, epsilon)
    S_safe = np.maximum(np.abs(S), epsilon)
    return rho * k * np.minimum(1.0 / omega_safe, a1 / (S_safe * F2))

def compute_Pk(k, omega):
    # Placeholder for turbulent production term
    return 0.0

# Finite difference method
def solve_k_omega():
    # Iterative solver setup
    max_iter = 1000
    tol = 1e-6
    epsilon = 1e-10  # Define epsilon here for use in the function

    for iteration in range(max_iter):
        k_old = k.copy()
        omega_old = omega.copy()

        # Compute turbulent viscosity
        S = 0.0  # Assuming zero strain rate for simplicity
        mu_t = compute_mu_t(k, omega, S)

        # Solve for k
        for i in range(1, n-1):
            Pk = compute_Pk(k[i], omega[i])
            A = (mu + mu_t[i] / sigma_k) / dy[i]**2
            B = (mu + mu_t[i] / sigma_k) / dy[i]**2
            C = -2 * (mu + mu_t[i] / sigma_k) / dy[i]**2 - beta_star * rho * omega[i]
            D = -Pk

            k[i] = (A * k[i-1] + B * k[i+1] + D) / C

        # Solve for omega
        for i in range(1, n-1):
            Pk = compute_Pk(k[i], omega[i])
            A = (mu + mu_t[i] * omega[i] / sigma_omega) / dy[i]**2
            B = (mu + mu_t[i] * omega[i] / sigma_omega) / dy[i]**2
            C = -2 * (mu + mu_t[i] * omega[i] / sigma_omega) / dy[i]**2 - beta * omega[i]**2
            # Add epsilon to mu_t[i] to avoid division by zero
            D = rho * Pk / (mu_t[i] + epsilon) + (1 - F1) * C_D * k[i] * omega[i]

            omega[i] = (A * omega[i-1] + B * omega[i+1] + D) / C

        # Check for convergence
        if np.linalg.norm(k - k_old) < tol and np.linalg.norm(omega - omega_old) < tol:
            print(f"Converged in {iteration} iterations.")
            break

    return k, omega

# Solve the PDEs
k_final, omega_final = solve_k_omega()

# Save the final solution
np.save('solution_k.npy', k_final)
np.save('solution_omega.npy', omega_final)
```

### Key Change:
- **Define `epsilon` within `solve_k_omega`**: The `epsilon` variable is now defined at the beginning of the `solve_k_omega` function, ensuring it is available for use in the calculations within that function. 

This should resolve the `NameError` and allow the code to run correctly.
