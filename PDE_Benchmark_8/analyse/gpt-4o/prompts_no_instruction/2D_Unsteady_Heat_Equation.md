# üîç Error Analysis Between Ground Truth and LLM-Generated ADI Solutions

This document compares two implementations of the 2D unsteady heat equation using the ADI (Alternating Direction Implicit) method: one from a ground truth reference and one generated by an LLM. Significant discrepancies are observed between the two, and below is a detailed analysis of the reasons behind the differences.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Initial Condition Handling

| Feature               | Ground Truth Code        | LLM-Generated Code         |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Initial Temperature   | `T = T0 + q`             | `T = np.zeros(...)`         |
| Source Term           | Included in initial cond | Separate from initial cond  |
| Boundary Conditions   | Set to `T0 = 1`          | Zero (implicitly or explicitly) |

**üß† Effect**: The LLM code does not incorporate the source term into the initial temperature, leading to an initially colder domain and inaccurate temperature evolution.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Source Term Application

| Feature         | Ground Truth Code            | LLM-Generated Code          |
|-----------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Source Coefficient | `0.5 * dt * q`             | `dt * q`                    |
| Symmetry           | Crank-Nicolson style       | Asymmetric application      |

**üß† Effect**: The LLM's asymmetric handling can cause instability or inaccurate heating, especially in regions with steep temperature gradients.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Boundary Condition Mismatch

| Boundary    | Ground Truth         | LLM Code            | Correct? |
|-------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------|
| All Sides   | Set to `T0 = 1`      | Set to `0`           | ‚ùå       |

**üß† Effect**: In the LLM code, boundaries are fixed at zero, which absorbs heat and distorts the natural temperature distribution intended by the problem setup.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ ADI Direction Switching

| Feature            | Ground Truth Code                    | LLM-Generated Code        |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Direction Control  | Alternates x/y per time step (`if n % 2 == 0`) | Always x then y         |
| Stability Enhancement | ‚úÖ Present                     | ‚ùå Missing                 |

**üß† Effect**: Alternating directions helps stabilize the ADI method. The LLM‚Äôs lack of switching can lead to directional bias or slower convergence.

## ‚úÖ Summary and Suggestions

| Issue                        | Root Cause                        | Recommendation                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Missing Source in Initial T | No `T = T0 + q`                   | Add source to initial temperature              |
| Incorrect Boundaries        | Always `T = 0`                    | Use physically meaningful boundaries           |
| Source Applied Asymmetrically | No `0.5 * dt * q`                | Use Crank-Nicolson-style weighting             |
| No ADI Direction Switching  | Missing alternation logic         | Add `if n % 2 == 0` to alternate directions     |

Together, these differences explain why the LLM-generated result deviates significantly from the ground truth. Fixing these issues will greatly improve the accuracy and stability of the generated solution.
