I apologize for the error and appreciate your patience. Below is the corrected Python code that solves the given one-dimensional linear convection equation using the Adams-Bashforth method. The error seems to have been introduced by a misalignment of shape during the computation of the `u` at time `n+1` with `delta_t / 2 * (3 * f_n - f_n_minus_1)`. By ensuring that all these variables align in their shapes, the program should run without any RuntimeError.

Please note that all array slicing (e.g. boundary conditions correction) and array computation should be done properly to avoid any dimension mismatch, which appears to have led to the exception in the previous code:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define parameters
c = 1.0
Nx = 101
a = -5.0
b = 5.0
epsilon_values = [0.0, 5.0e-4]
T = 1.0

x = np.linspace(a, b, Nx)  # Spatial grid
dx = x[1] - x[0]  # Spatial step size
dt = dx / (2 * np.abs(c))  # Time step size using CFL condition
Nt = int(T / dt)  # Number of time steps

# Function to compute spatial derivative
def spatial_derivative(u, dx, epsilon):
    return -c * (np.roll(u, -1) - np.roll(u, 1)) / (2 * dx) + epsilon * (np.roll(u, -1) - 2 * u + np.roll(u, 1)) / dx**2

# Initialize u and solve for each case
for epsilon in epsilon_values:
    u = np.zeros((Nt, Nx))  # Initialize u
    u[0] = np.exp(-x**2)  # Set the initial condition
    u[1] = u[0] + dt * spatial_derivative(u[0], dx, epsilon)  # First step with Euler method

    # Time integration with the 2-step Adams-Bashforth method
    for n in range(1, Nt-1):
        u_n = u[n]
        u_n_minus_1 = u[n-1]
        f_n = spatial_derivative(u_n, dx, epsilon)
        f_n_minus_1 = spatial_derivative(u_n_minus_1, dx, epsilon)
        u[n+1] = u_n + dt / 2 * (3 * f_n - f_n_minus_1)  # 2-step Adams-Bashforth method

    # Save the solution to a .npy file
    np.save(f"u_epsilon_{epsilon}.npy", u)

    # Plot the wave profile at different times
    plt.figure(figsize=(9, 6))
    for n in range(0, Nt, int(Nt / 10)):
        plt.plot(x, u[n], label=f"t = {n * dt:.2f}")
    plt.title(f"Wave profile over time, epsilon = {epsilon}")
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()
```
Before running the code, please ensure the required Python libraries are installed. Let me know how the solution works for you.
