The error you're encountering is due to a mismatch in the lengths of the diagonals when constructing the sparse matrix `A`. The diagonals need to match the size of the matrix, which is `(n, n)`. Let's correct the code by ensuring that the diagonals are properly defined for the tridiagonal matrix.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.sparse import diags
from scipy.sparse.linalg import spsolve

# Constants
H = 2.0  # Height of the domain
n = 100  # Number of grid points
rho = 1.0  # Density (assumed constant)
mu = 1.0e-3  # Molecular viscosity (assumed constant)

# Create a non-uniform mesh clustered near the walls
y = np.linspace(0, H, n)
dy = np.gradient(y)

# Spalart-Allmaras model parameters (simplified for demonstration)
def compute_mu_t(y):
    # Placeholder for the Spalart-Allmaras model
    # Here we use a simple model for demonstration
    return 0.1 * np.ones_like(y)

# Compute effective viscosity
mu_t = compute_mu_t(y)
mu_eff = mu + mu_t

# Discretize the PDE using finite differences
main_diag = np.zeros(n)
lower_diag = np.zeros(n-1)
upper_diag = np.zeros(n-1)

# Fill the diagonals
for i in range(1, n-1):
    lower_diag[i-1] = -mu_eff[i] / dy[i-1]
    main_diag[i] = mu_eff[i] / dy[i-1] + mu_eff[i+1] / dy[i]
    upper_diag[i] = -mu_eff[i+1] / dy[i]

# Boundary conditions: Dirichlet (u = 0 at both walls)
main_diag[0] = 1.0
main_diag[-1] = 1.0

# Create the sparse matrix
A = diags([lower_diag, main_diag, upper_diag], offsets=[-1, 0, 1], shape=(n, n)).tocsc()

# Right-hand side
b = -np.ones(n)
b[0] = 0.0
b[-1] = 0.0

# Solve the linear system
u = spsolve(A, b)

# Save the final solution as a .npy file
np.save('velocity_profile.npy', u)

# Plot the velocity profile
plt.plot(u, y, label='Turbulent Velocity Profile')
plt.xlabel('Velocity')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.title('Velocity Profile')
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

### Key Corrections:
1. **Diagonal Lengths**: The diagonals `main_diag`, `lower_diag`, and `upper_diag` are initialized with the correct lengths. The `main_diag` has length `n`, while `lower_diag` and `upper_diag` have length `n-1`.
2. **Loop for Filling Diagonals**: The loop correctly fills the diagonals, ensuring that the indices match the matrix size.
3. **Boundary Conditions**: The boundary conditions are applied directly to the `main_diag` to ensure the matrix is correctly set up for Dirichlet conditions.

This should resolve the error and correctly set up the sparse matrix for solving the PDE.
