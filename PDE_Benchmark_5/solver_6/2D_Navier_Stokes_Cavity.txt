The error you're seeing usually indicates that there is a problem with the usage of tabs and spaces in your Python script.

Python uses indentation to indicate the beginning and end of the block of codes. However, Python treats tabs and spaces differently, and they cannot be mixed together. For example, if you started a script using 4 spaces and somehow on line 22 you used tabs instead of spaces, you would see the IndentationError you're seeing.

To resolve this, you can do the following:

- Open your Python script
- Go to the view tab and toggle on 'Show Whitespace'
- Look at line 22 and the lines above it, see if the indentation is not aligned with the other lines of code
- Replace the tabs with spaces or vice versa, depending on what's preferable or what the rest of your code uses
- Save the changes and run your script again

If the problem persists, please share the actual code, then I can assist you more accurately. Based on your question, the issue appears to be syntactical rather than being a problem with CFD or finite difference methods.
