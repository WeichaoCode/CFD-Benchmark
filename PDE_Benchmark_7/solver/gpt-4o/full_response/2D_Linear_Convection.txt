### Explanation

- **Initialization**:
  - We initialize a grid of \(81 \times 81\) points, spanning a domain from 0 to 2 in both x and y directions.
  - Initial conditions are set with values of 2 within a central box and 1 otherwise.

- **Numerical Implementation**:
  - The finite difference method uses forward differencing for time and backward differencing for spatial derivatives.
  - The solution is stepped forward in time for 100 time steps, ensuring stability via the CFL condition.

- **Boundary Conditions**:
  - Boundary values are fixed at \( u = 1 \), which are enforced at every time step.

- **Visualization**:
  - The computed solution is visualized using a contour plot, providing an insight into how the wave propagates over the domain.

- **Output**:
  - The final state of the scalar field is saved in `.npy` format for further analysis or use.
