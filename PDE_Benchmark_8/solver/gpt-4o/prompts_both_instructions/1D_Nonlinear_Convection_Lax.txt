This code implements the Lax method to solve the given PDE with periodic boundary conditions. It simulates the wave propagation for 500 time steps and saves the final solution in a `.npy` file named `u_final.npy`. The spatial domain is discretized based on the given parameters, and the initial condition is set as specified. The periodic boundary conditions are applied using modulo indexing.
