The difficulty you're experiencing is typical of when attempting to solve a system of equations that doesn't have a unique solution. The error you're seeing is a LinAlgError indicating that you have a singular matrix, meaning it is not invertible.

In the context of your problem, this may be a result of improperly imposing boundary conditions, using incorrect parameters or because the matrix being created isn't well-posed. It's also possible that your solution isn't unique, so different correction algorithms (different iterative methods) might also come into play.

Here is a corrected version of the program. Here I'm using an iterative solver (Jacobi method) that can handle a singular matrix:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

h = 0.1
nx, ny = 50, 50
dP_dz = -3.2
mu = 1e-3
tol = 1e-6
max_it = 500

dx = h/nx
dy = h/ny

w_old = np.zeros((nx+1, ny+1))
w_new = np.zeros((nx+1, ny+1))

# Discretization based on central difference and Finite Volume Method
for it in range(max_it):
    for i in range(1, nx):
        for j in range(1, ny):
            a_E = mu/dx**2
            a_W = mu/dx**2
            a_N = mu/dy**2
            a_S = mu/dy**2

            a_P = a_E + a_W + a_N + a_S + (dP_dz/mu)

            w_new[i,j] = (a_E*w_old[i+1,j] + a_W*w_old[i-1,j] + a_N*w_old[i,j+1] + a_S*w_old[i,j-1] + dP_dz)/a_P

    if np.abs(w_new - w_old).max() < tol:
        break

    w_old = w_new.copy()

# Plotting
plt.contourf(w_new, cmap = "coolwarm")
plt.title("Contour of w-velocity")
plt.colorbar(label="w-velocity")
plt.show()
```

This Python script is simulating the 2D Diffusion Equation using the Finite Volume Method (FVM) in a square duct with the given parameters and the boundary conditions. The velocity distribution is displayed via a contour plot.

Also, note that I don't include the boundaries in the loops and am assuming that they are zero (according to the no-slip condition).  If you have different condition, you should modify the code to implement those conditions to avoid singular matrices.
