The error you're encountering is due to numerical instability, which can lead to overflow and singular matrices. This can happen if the values of `k` or `epsilon` become too large or too small during the iterations. To address this, we can implement a few strategies:

1. **Clipping Values**: Ensure that `k` and `epsilon` do not become too small or too large by clipping their values within a reasonable range.
2. **Improved Initialization**: Use a more realistic initial guess for `k` and `epsilon` based on typical turbulent flow values.
3. **Regularization**: Add a small regularization term to the diagonal of the matrix to prevent it from becoming singular.

Here's the updated code with these strategies:

```python
import numpy as np

# Constants
H = 2.0
n = 100
C_e1 = 1.44
C_e2 = 1.92
C_mu = 0.09
sigma_k = 1.0
sigma_epsilon = 1.3

# Functions for near-wall effects (placeholders, should be defined based on the model)
def f_1(y):
    return 1.0

def f_2(y):
    return 1.0

def f_mu(y):
    return 1.0

# Grid generation (non-uniform mesh clustered near the walls)
y = np.linspace(0, H, n)
dy = np.gradient(y)

# Initial conditions with more realistic small non-zero values
k = np.full(n, 0.01)
epsilon = np.full(n, 0.01)

# Placeholder for turbulent production term (should be defined based on the problem)
P_k = np.zeros(n)

# Material properties (placeholders, should be defined based on the problem)
rho = 1.0
mu = 1.0

# Small threshold to prevent division by zero
epsilon_threshold = 1e-10

# Solver loop (steady-state assumption)
for iteration in range(1000):  # Arbitrary number of iterations for steady-state convergence
    # Compute turbulent viscosity
    mu_t = C_mu * f_mu(y) * rho * np.clip(k**2 / (epsilon + epsilon_threshold), 0, 1e5)

    # Solve for k using finite difference method
    A_k = np.zeros((n, n))
    b_k = np.zeros(n)
    
    for i in range(1, n-1):
        A_k[i, i-1] = (mu + mu_t[i-1] / sigma_k) / dy[i-1]**2
        A_k[i, i] = -2 * (mu + mu_t[i] / sigma_k) / dy[i]**2 + 1e-8  # Regularization term
        A_k[i, i+1] = (mu + mu_t[i+1] / sigma_k) / dy[i+1]**2
        b_k[i] = P_k[i] - rho * epsilon[i]
    
    # Apply boundary conditions for k
    A_k[0, 0] = 1.0
    A_k[-1, -1] = 1.0
    b_k[0] = 0.0
    b_k[-1] = 0.0

    # Solve the linear system for k
    k_new = np.linalg.solve(A_k, b_k)

    # Solve for epsilon using finite difference method
    A_epsilon = np.zeros((n, n))
    b_epsilon = np.zeros(n)
    
    for i in range(1, n-1):
        A_epsilon[i, i-1] = (mu + mu_t[i-1] / sigma_epsilon) / dy[i-1]**2
        A_epsilon[i, i] = -2 * (mu + mu_t[i] / sigma_epsilon) / dy[i]**2 + 1e-8  # Regularization term
        A_epsilon[i, i+1] = (mu + mu_t[i+1] / sigma_epsilon) / dy[i+1]**2
        b_epsilon[i] = (epsilon[i] / (k[i] + epsilon_threshold)) * (C_e1 * f_1(y[i]) * P_k[i] - C_e2 * f_2(y[i]) * epsilon[i])
    
    # Apply boundary conditions for epsilon
    A_epsilon[0, 0] = 1.0
    A_epsilon[-1, -1] = 1.0
    b_epsilon[0] = 0.0
    b_epsilon[-1] = 0.0

    # Solve the linear system for epsilon
    epsilon_new = np.linalg.solve(A_epsilon, b_epsilon)

    # Check for convergence (simple check, can be improved)
    if np.linalg.norm(k_new - k) < 1e-6 and np.linalg.norm(epsilon_new - epsilon) < 1e-6:
        break

    # Update k and epsilon, with clipping to prevent overflow
    k = np.clip(k_new, 1e-6, 1e3)
    epsilon = np.clip(epsilon_new, 1e-6, 1e3)

# Save the final solution
np.save('k.npy', k)
np.save('epsilon.npy', epsilon)
```

In this version, I've added clipping to the values of `k` and `epsilon` to prevent them from becoming too large or too small, which can cause numerical issues. Additionally, a small regularization term is added to the diagonal of the matrices to help prevent them from becoming singular.
