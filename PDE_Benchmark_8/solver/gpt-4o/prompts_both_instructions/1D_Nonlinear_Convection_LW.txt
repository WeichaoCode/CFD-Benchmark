The overflow warnings indicate that the values of `u` are becoming too large during the computation, which can lead to numerical instability. This is often a sign that the numerical method is not stable for the given parameters. Let's address this by ensuring the method is implemented correctly and by checking the stability conditions.

Here's a revised version of the code with additional checks and corrections:

```python
import numpy as np
import math

# Parameters
L = 2 * np.pi
nu = 0.5
dt = 0.01
T = 500

# Calculate dx based on dt and nu
dx = dt / nu

# Discretize the spatial domain
x = np.linspace(0, L, math.ceil(L / dx))
nx = len(x)

# Initial condition
u = np.sin(x) + 0.5 * np.sin(0.5 * x)

# Lax-Wendroff method
for n in range(T):
    u_next = np.zeros_like(u)
    for j in range(nx):
        # Periodic boundary conditions
        jp1 = (j + 1) % nx
        jm1 = (j - 1) % nx
        
        # Flux
        F_jp1 = 0.5 * u[jp1]**2
        F_j = 0.5 * u[j]**2
        F_jm1 = 0.5 * u[jm1]**2
        
        # Jacobian
        A_jp1 = u[jp1]
        A_j = u[j]
        A_jm1 = u[jm1]
        
        # Lax-Wendroff update
        u_next[j] = (u[j] 
                     - dt / (2 * dx) * (F_jp1 - F_jm1) 
                     + (dt**2 / (2 * dx**2)) * (A_jp1 * (F_jp1 - F_j) - A_jm1 * (F_j - F_jm1)))
    
    # Update solution
    u = u_next

    # Check for overflow and reset if necessary
    if np.any(np.isnan(u)) or np.any(np.isinf(u)):
        print("Numerical instability detected. Stopping simulation.")
        break

# Save the final solution
np.save('u_final.npy', u)
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Overflow and NaN Check**: After each time step, the code checks if any values in `u` are `NaN` or `inf`. If so, it prints a message and stops the simulation. This helps identify when and if the solution becomes unstable.

2. **Stability Considerations**: The Lax-Wendroff method can be sensitive to the choice of `dt` and `dx`. Ensure that the CFL condition is satisfied. If the problem persists, consider reducing `dt` or increasing `dx` to improve stability.

3. **Debugging**: If the problem continues, consider printing intermediate values of `u` to diagnose where the instability occurs.

This code should help identify and prevent overflow issues by stopping the simulation if instability is detected. If the problem persists, further adjustments to the numerical parameters may be necessary.
