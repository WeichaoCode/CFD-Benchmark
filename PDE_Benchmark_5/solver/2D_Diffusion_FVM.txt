The error `numpy.linalg.LinAlgError: Matrix is singular` is thrown when you attempt to perform a matrix operation that requires the inverse of a matrix that is singular. A singular matrix is one where the determinant is zero and thus the matrix does not have an inverse.

Since this error is occurring in the `solve(A, b)` call, the issue is with the `A` matrix, which is singular. This issue might have occurred due to the boundary conditions not being properly implemented, or due to the initialization of the `w` variable.

Here's how you might approach fixing the issue:

1. **Check your Boundary Conditions**: In your problem set, you're given no-slip boundary conditions for the `w` velocity at the walls. This means `w=0`.
   
2. **Check your initial conditions**: Your initial guess for `_w` can heavily impact the convergence of your calculation. However, the initialization should not play a role in whether or not `A` is singular.

3. **Check your equation Assembly**: When you assembled your discretized equations into the matrix `A` and the vector `b`, you likely made a mistake, leading to a singular matrix.
   
Here is an example code with corrections by considering the boundary conditions and initial conditions in the formulation:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.linalg import solve
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define parameters
h = 0.1
nx, ny = 100, 100
dP_dz, mu = -3.2, 1.0e-3
dx = h / (nx - 1)
dy = h / (ny - 1)

# Initialize the w-velocity
w = np.zeros((nx, ny))

# Assemble the system of equations
A = np.zeros((nx * ny, nx * ny))
b = np.zeros(nx * ny)

for i in range(1, nx-1):
    for j in range(1, ny-1):

        west = i - 1 + j * nx
        east = i + 1 + j * nx
        north = i + (j+1) * nx
        south = i + (j-1) * nx
        center = i + j * nx

        aw = mu/dx**2
        ae = mu/dx**2
        an = mu/dy**2
        aso = mu/dy**2
        ac = aw + ae + an + aso

        A[center, west] = -aw
        A[center, east] = -ae
        A[center, north] = -an
        A[center, south] = -aso
        A[center, center] = ac

        b[center] = - dP_dz

# Apply boundary conditions
for i in range(nx):
    for j in [0, ny-1]:
        center = i + j * nx
        A[center, :] = 0
        A[center, center] = 1.0
        b[center] = 0
        
for j in range(ny):
    for i in [0, nx-1]:
        center = i + j * nx
        A[center, :] = 0
        A[center, center] = 1.0
        b[center] = 0

w = solve(A, b)

# Reshape the solution to a 2D array for plotting
w = w.reshape((nx, ny))

# Visualize the velocity distribution
plt.contourf(w, levels=50)
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()
```

This should avoid issues related to the singularity of the matrix since boundary cells are accounted for properly this time around. The solution `w` visualized using `pyplot`'s `contourf` should represent the velocity distribution.
