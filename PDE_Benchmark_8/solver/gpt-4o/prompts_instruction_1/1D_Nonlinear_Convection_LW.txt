The warnings you're encountering are likely due to numerical instability, which can cause overflow and invalid operations. This is a common issue when dealing with nonlinear PDEs, especially when the solution becomes steep or when the time step is too large relative to the spatial step.

To address these issues, we can try the following:
1. **Reduce the Time Step**: Decrease `dt` to ensure stability.
2. **Check CFL Condition**: Ensure that the CFL condition is satisfied for stability.
3. **Limit the Solution**: Implement a limiter to prevent unphysical values.

Let's adjust the code to reduce the time step and ensure stability:

```python
import numpy as np

# Parameters
L = 2 * np.pi
nu = 0.5
dt = 0.001  # Reduced time step for stability
dx = dt / nu
T = 500  # number of time steps

# Discretize the spatial domain
x = np.linspace(0, L, int(np.ceil(L / dx)), endpoint=False)
nx = len(x)

# Initial condition
u = np.sin(x) + 0.5 * np.sin(0.5 * x)

# Lax-Wendroff method
for n in range(T):
    u_next = np.zeros_like(u)
    for j in range(nx):
        # Periodic boundary conditions
        jp1 = (j + 1) % nx
        jm1 = (j - 1) % nx
        
        # Flux
        F_jp1 = 0.5 * u[jp1]**2
        F_jm1 = 0.5 * u[jm1]**2
        F_j = 0.5 * u[j]**2
        
        # Jacobian
        A_jp1 = u[jp1]
        A_j = u[j]
        A_jm1 = u[jm1]
        
        # Lax-Wendroff update
        u_next[j] = (u[j] 
                     - dt / (2 * dx) * (F_jp1 - F_jm1) 
                     + dt**2 / (2 * dx**2) * (A_jp1 * (F_jp1 - F_j) - A_jm1 * (F_j - F_jm1)))
    
    u = u_next

# Save the final solution
np.save('final_solution.npy', u)
```

### Key Changes:
- **Reduced `dt`**: The time step `dt` is reduced to `0.001` to improve stability.
- **CFL Condition**: The CFL condition is implicitly checked by ensuring `dt` is small enough relative to `dx`.

This should help mitigate the overflow and invalid value warnings. If the problem persists, further reducing `dt` or implementing a flux limiter might be necessary.
