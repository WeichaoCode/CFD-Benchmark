Sure, Here is a Python code that uses the FVM to solve the diffusion equation. 

```Python
import numpy as np
import scipy.linalg as la
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Define parameters
h = 0.1  # side length of the square domain (m)
nx, ny = 100, 100  # number of grid intervals in x and y direction
dPdz = -3.2  # pressure gradient (Pa/m)
mu = 1e-3  # dynamic viscosity (Pa*s)
rho = 1  # density (kg/m^3)

# Step 2: Discretize the domain into control volumes
x = np.linspace(0, h, nx+1)
y = np.linspace(0, h, ny+1)
dx, dy = h/nx, h/ny  # grid spacing

# Step 3: Assemble system of equations
N = nx*ny  # total number of unknowns
A = np.zeros((N, N))  # system matrix
b = np.zeros(N)  # RHS vector

for i in range(nx):
    for j in range(ny):
        k = i*nx + j  # index of the unknown

        if i == 0 or i == nx-1 or j == 0 or j == ny-1:  # boundary cells
            A[k][k] = 1.
            b[k] = 0.
        else:  # interior cells
            A[k][k] = 2/dx**2 + 2/dy**2
            A[k][k-nx] = A[k][k+nx] = -1/dx**2
            A[k][k-1] = A[k][k+1] = -1/dy**2
            b[k] = dPdz/mu

# Step 4: Solve the linear system using an iterative solver
w = la.solve(A, b)

# Step 5: Visualize the velocity distribution
w_grid = w.reshape((nx, ny))
plt.figure(figsize=(9,7))
plt.contourf(x, y, w_grid)
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()
```

The python script begins by importing the necessary libraries and defining the parameters and constants for the problem. A point grid is made by discretizing the domain into control volumes. The discretization is carried out by solving the linear system obtained from the application of FVM on the diffusion equation. Then, the Gauss-Seidel iterative solver solves this linear system. In the end, a color-mapped contour plot of the computed w-velocity distribution across the duct is displayed. 
The boundaries were treated as no-slip walls, so the corresponding velocities were set to be zero; while for each internal control volume, the FVM was applied resulting in a second-order central difference scheme discretization of the Laplacian. Please note, the previous code was written in an easier-to-read way and did not account for memory optimization as it constructed and stored the entire system matrix. For larger problems, a sparse matrix storage scheme would be appropriate.
