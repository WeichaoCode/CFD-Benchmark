Okay, let's correct the issue with the initial code and continue to develop the Python program. Here is an example of how you might proceed:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# setting the spatial and dimensional constants
Nx = 51    # number of grid points in x direction
Ny = 41    # number of grid points in y direction
x = np.linspace(0, 5, Nx)   # x direction
y = np.linspace(0, 4, Ny)   # y direction

# Creating 2D grid points
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x,y)

# Initialize the solution (temperature) array
T = np.zeros((Nx,Ny))

# Set thermal boundary conditions
T[:,0] = 10  # x=0
T[0,:] = 0   # y=4
T[:,Ny-1] = 40  # x=5
T[Nx-1,:] = 20  # y=0

# Iterate to converge to the solution
tolerance = 1e-5  
max_iterations = 500  
converged = False
iterations = 0

while not converged and iterations < max_iterations:
    T_new = T.copy()
    iterations += 1
    # loop for x and y (ignoring boundaries)
    for i in range(1, Nx-1):
        for j in range(1, Ny-1):
            T_new[i][j] = 0.5 * (T[i+1][j] + T[i-1][j] + T[i][j+1] + T[i][j-1])
    if np.max(np.abs(T_new - T)) < tolerance:
        converged = True
    T = T_new.copy()

# Create a filled contour plot
plt.figure(figsize=(8,7))
cs = plt.contourf(X, Y, T.T, cmap='hot',levels=100)
plt.colorbar(cs)
plt.title('Steady State 2D Heat Equation Solution')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.show()
```

This program first sets up the problem, specifying the domain size and the grid resolution. It initializes the temperature distribution T and sets the thermal boundary conditions.

It then enters the main iterative loop of the program, which continues until the solution has converged (or the maximum iteration count is reached). Within this loop, it computes a new estimate of the temperature distribution using the finite difference method.

The program then tests for convergence by comparing the new estimate of T with the previous estimate. If the maximum absolute difference is less than a specified tolerance, it declares the solution converged and exits the loop.

Finally, the program creates a filled contour plot to visualize the computed temperature distribution. The figure shows the temperature (color-coded) as a function of position in the 2D domain.
