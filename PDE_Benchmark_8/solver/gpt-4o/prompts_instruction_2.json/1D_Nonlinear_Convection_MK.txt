Below is the Python code to solve the given partial differential equation using the MacCormack method. The code applies periodic boundary conditions and saves the final solution at the last time step in a `.npy` file.

```python
import numpy as np
import math

# Parameters
L = 2 * np.pi
nu = 0.5
dt = 0.01
dx = dt / nu
T = 500

# Discretize the spatial domain
x = np.linspace(0, L, math.ceil(L / dx))
nx = len(x)

# Initial condition
u = np.sin(x) + 0.5 * np.sin(0.5 * x)

# MacCormack method
for n in range(T):
    # Predictor step
    u_pred = np.copy(u)
    for i in range(nx - 1):
        u_pred[i] = u[i] - (dt / dx) * u[i] * (u[i+1] - u[i])
    
    # Apply periodic boundary condition for predictor
    u_pred[-1] = u[-1] - (dt / dx) * u[-1] * (u[0] - u[-1])
    
    # Corrector step
    u_corr = np.copy(u_pred)
    for i in range(1, nx):
        u_corr[i] = 0.5 * (u[i] + u_pred[i] - (dt / dx) * u_pred[i] * (u_pred[i] - u_pred[i-1]))
    
    # Apply periodic boundary condition for corrector
    u_corr[0] = 0.5 * (u[0] + u_pred[0] - (dt / dx) * u_pred[0] * (u_pred[0] - u_pred[-1]))
    
    # Update solution
    u = np.copy(u_corr)

# Save the final solution
np.save('final_solution.npy', u)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The spatial domain is discretized using `np.linspace` based on the given parameters. The initial condition is set as a combination of sine functions.

2. **MacCormack Method**:
   - **Predictor Step**: Computes the predicted values using a forward difference scheme.
   - **Corrector Step**: Uses the predicted values to compute the corrected values using a backward difference scheme.
   - **Periodic Boundary Conditions**: Applied at both the predictor and corrector steps to ensure continuity across the domain boundaries.

3. **Time Integration**: The loop runs for `T = 500` time steps, updating the solution at each step.

4. **Output**: The final solution is saved as a `.npy` file using `np.save`.

This code will solve the PDE and save the final state of the wave amplitude `u(x, T)` after 500 time steps.
