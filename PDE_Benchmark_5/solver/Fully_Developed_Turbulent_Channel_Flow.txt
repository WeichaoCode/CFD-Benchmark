The error message indicates that the matrix `A` is singular and cannot be inverted directly to solve the linear system. This often means the system of equations is either underdetermined or overdetermined with no exact solutions. Alternatively, there might be linearly dependent rows in `A` meaning some equations are just linear combinations of others.

In order to solve the singular matrix problem, we need to verify that the system of equations is well-posed, the coefficient matrix is diagonally dominant, and the boundary conditions are correctly enforced in the system. Here is a corrected implementation.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define parameters
H = 1.0    # channel height
ny = 101   # number of grid points
mu = 1.0e-3   # kinematic viscosity
mut = lambda y: 0.01 * (1 - 4*y*(1-y)/H**2)  # eddy viscosity profile
dy = H / (ny - 1)  # grid spacing

# Discretize the domain
y = np.linspace(0, H, ny)

# Assemble the coefficient matrix A and RHS vector b
A = np.zeros((ny, ny))
b = -np.ones(ny)  # constant pressure gradient

for i in range(1, ny-1):
  A[i, i-1] = -(mu + mut(y[i-1])) / dy**2
  A[i, i] = ((mu + mut(y[i-1])) + (mu + mut(y[i+1]))) / dy**2
  A[i, i+1] = -(mu + mut(y[i+1])) / dy**2

# Enforce boundary conditions
A[0, 0] = A[-1, -1] = 1.0
b[0] = b[-1] = 0.0

# Solve for velocity u
u = np.linalg.solve(A, b)

# Visualize the velocity profile
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 8))
plt.plot(u, y)
plt.xlabel('Velocity u')
plt.ylabel('Height y')
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```
This script solves for the velocity profile `u(y)` in a fully-developed turbulent channel flow using the finite difference method and a direct solver. The resulting velocity profile satisfies the no-slip condition at the walls and is influenced by both molecular and turbulent diffusion. The problem was fixed by correctly enforcing the no-slip boundary conditions in the assembled system and ensuring that the coefficient matrix is non-singular by having the diagonals dominate the off-diagonals in each row.
