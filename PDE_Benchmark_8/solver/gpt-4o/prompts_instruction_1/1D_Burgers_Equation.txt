The error you're encountering is due to a mismatch in array sizes when performing the finite difference operations. This typically happens when the indexing for the finite difference scheme is not correctly aligned with the array sizes. Let's correct the code by ensuring that the array operations are properly aligned.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

# Parameters
nx = 101
nt = 100
nu = 0.07
x_start = 0
x_end = 2 * np.pi
dx = (x_end - x_start) / (nx - 1)
dt = dx * nu

# Spatial grid
x = np.linspace(x_start, x_end, nx)

# Initial condition
phi = np.exp(-x**2 / (4 * nu)) + np.exp(-(x - 2 * np.pi)**2 / (4 * nu))
u = -2 * nu / phi * np.gradient(phi, dx) + 4

# Time-stepping loop
for n in range(nt):
    u_old = u.copy()
    # Upwind scheme for convection term
    for i in range(1, nx-1):
        u[i] = u_old[i] - dt / dx * u_old[i] * (u_old[i] - u_old[i-1]) + \
               nu * dt / dx**2 * (u_old[i+1] - 2 * u_old[i] + u_old[i-1])
    # Periodic boundary conditions
    u[0] = u[-1]
    u[-1] = u[0]

# Save the final solution
np.save('final_solution.npy', u)
```

### Key Corrections:
- **Loop for Spatial Indexing**: The convection and diffusion terms are now computed within a loop that iterates over the spatial indices from `1` to `nx-2`. This ensures that the finite difference operations are correctly applied to the interior points.
- **Boundary Conditions**: The periodic boundary conditions are applied by setting `u[0]` equal to `u[-1]` and vice versa, ensuring the solution wraps around correctly.

This corrected code should resolve the broadcasting error and correctly compute the solution to the PDE. The final solution is saved as a 1D NumPy array in `final_solution.npy`.
